    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
    The <strong>Corah Centre for Rural Aging & Health</strong> is dedicated to promoting
    wellness, innovation, and community engagement among older adults in rural Nova Scotia.
    We believe that technology, design, and compassion can come together to create
    meaningful change for individuals and communities.

    <p>
    Our multidisciplinary team of students, researchers, and community partners
    collaborates on projects that bridge digital inclusion, healthcare access,
    and environmental design. Whether developing digital tools, running workshops,
    or conducting local research, Corah’s mission is to make aging in rural areas
    healthier and more connected.
