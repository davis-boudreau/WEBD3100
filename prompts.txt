I have not been clear on button states, background colors for list and dark, separator color and  specifications, and we have not considered light and dark themes.  Also, I see that flex-wrap is not used so that the header can resize for smaller resolutions.  The brand-logo and brand-workmark-logo need min and max values.  Also I really need this workshop to be in the context of teaching students the most important concepts.  

I also need a section to explain to the web developer that there are key requirements that must be provided by the web designer.  I have provided some to you but we need a specific list otherwise the developer will be designing so I am going to provide a list and further define what I missed below:

Components
- logos file names and types, min and max from figma
   - corah-brand-logo.svg
   - corah-brand-wordmark-logo.svg

- button specifics color, radius, states etc. and min and max widths

Color System
- brand color and ramp
- neutral color and ramp
- secondart color and ramp
- light and dark background

Typography
 - font style and source
- scaling (min and max)
- base font size

Device Layouts
- padding, gap for containers
- desktop, tablet and mobile layouts light theme
- desktop, tablet and mobile layouts light theme 

for the light theme, we use a white background 
for the dark theme, we use brand-95 background

The button in the nav should wrap and the nav-container should wrap
