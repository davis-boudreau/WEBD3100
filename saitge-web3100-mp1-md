## **4. Instructions**

### 4.1 Use Case

CORAH requires a modern, accessible web application for seniors, focusing on event management, user registration, and admin functions. The system should also generate printable posters/flyers from event data. Students act as web designers, tasked with evaluating usability and accessibility, and documenting requirements.

### 4.2 Tasks

4.2.1 Explore the CORAH Concept

* Review project brief (events, registration, admin, print features)
* Identify potential user challenges for seniors and staff

4.2.2 Usability Evaluation

* Apply usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen’s principles)
* Identify at least 5 usability issues or opportunities

4.2.3 Accessibility Assessment

* Consider color contrast, font size, readability, navigation simplicity
* Suggest improvements for senior-friendly access

4.2.4 Content Inventory & Sitemap

* Create a sitemap showing main sections (Home, Events, Register, Admin)
* For each page, list required content (text, images, forms, buttons)

4.2.5 Recommendations

* Summarize usability and accessibility findings
* Outline functional requirements for the web app
* Include notes on print/flyer generation feature ideas

### 4.3 Reflection

* What were the most critical usability issues you identified?
* How did accessibility considerations influence your sitemap or content choices?
* What features would most improve CORAH staff efficiency?
* How did you balance user needs (seniors) with administrative functionality?

### 4.4 Deliverables

4.4.1 1-page Website Critique Report (PDF or Word)
