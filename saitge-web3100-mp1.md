## Instructions

### Use Case

CORAH requires a modern, accessible web application for seniors, focusing on event management, user registration, and admin functions. The system should also generate printable posters/flyers from event data. Students act as web designers, tasked with evaluating usability and accessibility, and documenting requirements.

### Tasks

* **Explore the CORAH Concept:** Review the project brief, including events, registration, admin, and print features; identify potential user challenges for seniors and staff.
* **Usability Evaluation:** Apply usability heuristics (e.g., Nielsen’s principles) and identify at least five usability issues or opportunities.
* **Accessibility Assessment:** Consider color contrast, font size, readability, and navigation simplicity; suggest improvements for senior-friendly access.
* **Content Inventory & Sitemap:** Create a sitemap showing main sections (Home, Events, Register, Admin) and list required content for each page (text, images, forms, buttons).
* **Recommendations:** Summarize usability and accessibility findings, outline functional requirements for the web app, and include notes on print/flyer generation feature ideas.

### Reflection

* What were the most critical usability issues you identified?
* How did accessibility considerations influence your sitemap or content choices?
* What features would most improve CORAH staff efficiency?
* How did you balance user needs (seniors) with administrative functionality?

### Deliverables

* **Website Critique Report:** One-page summary (PDF or Word) of usability and accessibility evaluation with key findings and recommendations.
* **Sitemap Diagram:** Digital or hand-drawn representation of site structure.
* **Content Inventory Table:** Page-wise list of required content/components.
