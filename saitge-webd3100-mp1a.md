## **2. Overview / Purpose / Objectives**

This first mini-project introduces students to **evaluating website design quality** using **established design and accessibility principles**.

By critically assessing a real website, students will begin to recognize what makes digital interfaces usable, engaging, and inclusive. This assignment builds the foundation for later design and implementation work.

**Purpose:**
To develop analytical and evaluative skills in identifying good and poor design practices in existing websites.

**Objectives:**

* Apply **core design principles** to assess content presentation and layout.
* Identify **accessibility concerns** that impact usability and inclusion.
* Communicate findings through a clear, structured written report.

| **LO1**              | Apply design principles to web design fundamentals in terms of content presentation. |

---

## **4. Assignment Description / Use Case**

You will select a **real-world website** (e.g., a community organization, small business, educational site, or government portal) that **you believe could be improved** in terms of layout, readability, or accessibility.

You will **evaluate the site** using the **core web design principles** and **basic accessibility guidelines** introduced in class.
Your evaluation should be evidence-based and demonstrate understanding of what makes effective, user-friendly, and accessible design.

---

## **5. Tasks / Instructions**

### **Step 1 – Website Selection**

* Choose one publicly accessible website.
* Preferably select a small-to-medium site (not overly complex or highly polished).
* Confirm with your instructor if you’re uncertain about your choice.

### **Step 2 – Design Principles Evaluation**

Evaluate your chosen site using the **six core design principles** covered in class:

| **Design Principle**             | **Pragmatic Definition (for Course Use)**                                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Contrast**                     | Ensures text and key elements are visually distinct from backgrounds to improve readability and focus. |
| **Alignment**                    | Visual elements are intentionally placed to create logical structure and flow.                         |
| **Repetition**                   | Consistent use of colors, fonts, and patterns to reinforce identity and cohesion.                      |
| **Proximity**                    | Related elements are grouped to enhance clarity and association.                                       |
| **Balance**                      | Visual equilibrium achieved between text, imagery, and white space.                                    |
| **White Space (Negative Space)** | Empty areas that give the design breathing room and improve readability.                               |

Provide **specific examples** (e.g., screenshots or observations) illustrating how these principles are applied—or violated—on the chosen site.

### **Step 3 – Accessibility Evaluation**

Use the following **introductory accessibility principles** (based on WCAG guidelines, adapted for early learners):

| **Accessibility Principle** | **Definition**                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Perceivable**             | All users can perceive content (e.g., alt text for images, clear contrast, readable text). |
| **Operable**                | Navigation and interactions are usable by keyboard and mouse.                              |
| **Understandable**          | Content and layout are consistent, predictable, and easy to follow.                        |
| **Robust**                  | The site works across browsers, devices, and assistive technologies.                       |

### **Step 4 – Reflection and Recommendations**

* Reflect on what worked well and what didn’t.
* Suggest 2–3 improvements (e.g., fix contrast, reorganize layout, add alt text).
* Explain **why** each recommendation improves the user experience.

### **Step 5 – Report Formatting**

Your report should include:

1. Title page (name, student number, course, date, and website URL)
2. Brief site overview (1 paragraph)
3. Design principle evaluation (approx. 2–3 pages)
4. Accessibility evaluation (approx. 1–2 pages)
5. Reflection and recommendations (1 page)
6. References (if applicable)
