## **2. Overview / Purpose / Objectives**

This assignment develops empathy-based design skills using the **CORAH case study** ‚Äî a non-profit community initiative supporting **rural Nova Scotia seniors (60 +)** through wellness events, volunteer programs, and outreach communications.

You will translate research and discussion into **personas** that represent CORAH‚Äôs key users and a set of **requirements** defining what the organization‚Äôs website must achieve for accessibility, usability, and inclusivity.

**Purpose**
To connect user research with design planning by defining who the CORAH website serves and what functions it must provide to meet their diverse needs.

**Objectives**

* Develop user personas that reflect CORAH‚Äôs real community audiences.
* Identify user goals, barriers, and accessibility needs.
* Translate those findings into concrete, testable website requirements.

## **3. Learning Outcomes Addressed**

| **Outcome #** | **Description**                                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LO1**       | Apply design principles to web design fundamentals in content presentation.  |
| **LO2**       | Design mock-ups of user interfaces based on requirements and specifications. |

---

## **4. Assignment Description / Use Case**

The **CORAH website** must serve two primary audiences:

1. **Senior Citizens (60 +)** ‚Äì often in rural or semi-rural areas, with varying digital literacy and accessibility needs (larger text, simple navigation, clear language).
2. **CORAH Staff & Volunteers** ‚Äì administrators who create event listings, manage communication, and post updates for the community.

You will identify their needs and expectations, then produce:

1. **Two User Personas** (one senior citizen and one staff or volunteer).
2. A structured list of **Functional**, **Design**, and **Accessibility Requirements** that will guide the website‚Äôs design phase.

---

## **5. Tasks / Instructions**

### **Step 1 ‚Äì Review Case Study and Research Findings**

* Review your MP1A evaluation and class discussions on the current state of community and non-profit websites.
* Note key issues: poor readability, low contrast, unclear navigation, mobile access challenges.
* Identify what would help CORAH‚Äôs audience find information about programs, events, and volunteering.

---

### **Step 2 ‚Äì Create User Personas**

Use the provided **Figma Persona Template** (or Canva/UXPressia alternative).
Each persona should include:

| **Section**         | **Description / Guidance (Example for CORAH)**                                            |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name & Photo        | ‚ÄúMary MacNeil ‚Äì Retired Teacher (Louisdale, NS)‚Äù  *Representative photo or illustration.* |
| Demographics        | Age, location, living situation, digital skills (e.g., uses tablet daily).                |
| Goals               | Find local wellness events; register for community activities without assistance.         |
| Frustrations        | Small text sizes, poor contrast, confusing navigation.                                    |
| Behaviours          | Prefers simple interfaces, reads on tablet in large font mode.                            |
| Accessibility Needs | Screen reader compatibility, larger buttons, high-contrast colors.                        |
| Quote               | ‚ÄúI love connecting with people, but websites can be so hard to use!‚Äù                      |
| Tech Usage          | Owns an iPad and uses email occasionally.                                                 |

> üí° *Tip:* Design one persona for a senior user and one for a CORAH staff or volunteer. Keep each concise (one Figma frame or half page).

**Figma Template Link (Example Structure):**

```
[Frame Title: CORAH Persona Template]
- Header: Persona Name & Photo  
- Left Column: Demographics, Behaviours, Accessibility Needs  
- Right Column: Goals, Frustrations, Quote  
- Footer: ‚ÄúDesign Implications‚Äù notes section for students to summarize what this means for UI design.  
```

### **Step 3 ‚Äì Define Functional, Design & Accessibility Requirements**

Translate each persona‚Äôs goals into requirements that will guide the next mini-projects (MP1C and MP2).
Use the following table as a starting template (you can adapt in Word or Figma):

| **Requirement Type** | **Requirement Statement**                                            | **Linked Persona / User Goal**                                 | **Priority** |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Functional           | Users must be able to register for events online with minimal steps. | Mary MacNeil ‚Äì Find and register for activities independently. | High         |
| Functional           | Staff must be able to add new events through a simple form.          | CORAH Volunteer ‚Äì Update event listings.                       | High         |
| Design               | Use large legible fonts and clear color contrast (AA minimum).       | Mary MacNeil ‚Äì Accessibility readability need.                 | High         |
| Accessibility        | Keyboard-navigable menus and alt text for all images.                | All users ‚Äì Inclusive design.                                  | Medium       |
| Design               | Navigation limited to 5 main menu items with descriptive labels.     | All users ‚Äì Ease of use.                                       | Medium       |

> üí¨ *Tip:* Think of requirements as your ‚Äúproject blueprint.‚Äù Each should be measurable and testable later in MP3 (Implementation).
