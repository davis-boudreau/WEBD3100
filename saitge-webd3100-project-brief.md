# üìë Project Brief ‚Äì CORAH Web Application

## 1. Client Overview

**CORAH (Centre of Rural and Aging Health)** is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for seniors in rural communities. CORAH promotes health and wellbeing services, education, and community engagement opportunities, with a strong emphasis on accessibility, inclusivity, and usability for older adults.

## 2. Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **modern, highly accessible web application** that allows seniors to discover, register for, and participate in CORAH events. The platform must also empower administrators to efficiently manage events, participants, and promotional materials, while ensuring a **centralized hub** for both digital and print-based outreach.
