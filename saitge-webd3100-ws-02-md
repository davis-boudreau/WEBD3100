# **Workshop: Evaluating Sample Websites with Design Principles**

### 🎯 Learning Goal

Students will learn how to **apply core design principles** (contrast, alignment, repetition, proximity, balance, white space, accessibility) to analyze and evaluate existing websites, with a focus on usability and content presentation.

---

## 1. **Mini-Theory Primer (Instructor Demo – 15 min)**

Before the hands-on work, the instructor introduces and demonstrates:

* **Contrast:** Does the design use color, size, and weight effectively?
* **Alignment:** Are elements visually aligned to create order?
* **Repetition:** Are consistent design patterns used (e.g., buttons, headings)?
* **Proximity:** Are related items grouped together?
* **Balance & White Space:** Does the design feel open, readable, and uncluttered?
* **Accessibility:** Can all users access and understand the content (color choices, font sizes, alternative text)?

💡 **Demo:** Instructor opens a sample website on the projector and “thinks aloud,” pointing out both good and poor design examples based on these principles.

## 2. **Guided Activity (Paired Work – 20 min)**

Students are paired up and provided with 2–3 different website examples (mix of strong and weak designs).

**Task:**

1. Use the **Design Principles Checklist** (provided below).
2. Identify at least **two strengths** and **two weaknesses** in each site.
3. Compare findings with a partner.

**Design Principles Checklist**
✔ Contrast is used to highlight important content.
✔ Alignment is consistent across sections.
✔ Repetition reinforces the brand/design style.
✔ Proximity groups related content.
✔ White space is balanced for readability.
✔ Accessibility (alt text, font size, color contrast) is considered.

## 3. **Independent Evaluation (Hands-On – 25 min)**

* Students choose **one website relevant to the case study theme** (e.g., healthcare, education, nonprofit — depending on case study defined in Week 1).
* Apply the checklist to this site.
* Write a **short evaluation report (1–2 pages)** including:

  * A screenshot of the homepage.
  * A table of principles with “observations” and “improvements suggested.”
  * A brief conclusion: *Would you recommend this site as a good model? Why/why not?*

---

## 4. **Reflection & Discussion (20 min)**

* **Class share-out:** Volunteers present one strength and one weakness they found.
* Instructor facilitates a discussion on how design principles **impact user experience** and how this analysis process will guide their own projects.

**Reflection Prompt (written submission):**

> “Which design principle do you think will be most challenging to apply in your own project, and why?”

---

## 5. **Deliverable (Mini-Project 1 – Week 1)**

* **Evaluation Report (10%)**

  * Table of design principle observations.
  * Suggested improvements.
  * Reflection paragraph.
