# Sample Accessibility Checklist

**Website Tested:** CNN.com (Sept 2025)

---

### 1. Screen Reader

* **Headings:**

  * Major headlines announced correctly.
  * Some sidebar items lacked heading structure (skipped from H1 to H4).
* **Links & Buttons:**

  * Many links labeled “Read More” or “Watch” — unclear out of context.
  * Social media icons announced only as “link,” with no description.
* **Images:**

  * Main news images had useful alt text.
  * Decorative images (icons, dividers) were sometimes read as “graphic,” adding noise.
* **Reading Order:**

  * Generally logical, but ads interrupted content flow.

---

### 2. Color Contrast

* **Pass examples:**

  * Black body text on white background (ratio 21:1).
  * Headline text (#000 on #f2f2f2) passes comfortably.
* **Fail examples:**

  * Light gray navigation links (#aaa on white) = 2.1:1 → FAIL.
  * Red link text (#e21d1d on white) = 3.9:1 → FAIL (needs 4.5:1).

---

### 3. Keyboard Navigation

* **Focus Indicators:** Present, but faint (light blue, hard to see).
* **Menus:** Dropdown menus difficult to use with Tab — only expand with mouse hover.
* **Forms:** Search bar reachable and usable.
* **General Navigation:** Took \~25 tabs to reach footer → very long path, no “skip to content” link.

---

### 4. General Observations

* **Strengths:**

  * Professional semantic structure overall.
  * Alt text provided for most editorial images.
  * Clear contrast for main body content.
* **Weaknesses:**

  * Poor keyboard usability for dropdowns.
  * Low-contrast links reduce readability.
  * Repetitive “Read More” links harm screen reader usability.

# Reflection — Key Takeaways

Testing CNN with accessibility tools showed me how differently people experience the same site. Using a screen reader was eye-opening — the page felt overwhelming with ads and poorly labeled links. I realized that alt text and heading order aren’t “extras,” but essential for comprehension.

The color contrast test surprised me — text that looked fine visually actually failed standards, which means users with vision impairments might struggle.

The hardest part was navigating without a mouse. Menus that were easy with a cursor became frustrating with the keyboard. I now understand how crucial it is to design with **multiple interaction methods** in mind.

**Most important lesson:** Accessibility isn’t just compliance; it’s usability for real people. Going forward, I’ll prioritize meaningful link labels, skip links, and stronger contrast.

# Reflection — Key Takeaways

Write a short reflection (½ page) on:

* What surprised you about accessibility testing?
* Which issues stood out most?
* How will this experience affect how you design websites in the future?
