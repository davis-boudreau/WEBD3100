# Workshop 02: Accessibility Testing & Tools

**Topic:** Accessibility testing & tools

**Learning Activities:** Screen reader demo; color contrast checks; keyboard navigation

**Deliverable:** Accessibility checklist for a chosen site

## Step 1 — Set Up and Choose a Website

1. Open your preferred browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).
2. Choose a public website you’d like to test. This could be a news site, a retail store, or even your college homepage.

   * Avoid overly simple one-page sites.
   * Pick something with menus, text, images, and forms.
3. Bookmark the site — you’ll return to it several times during the workshop.

## Step 2 — Screen Reader Demo

1. Install or launch a screen reader:

   * **Windows:** NVDA (free) or Narrator (built-in).
   * **Mac:** VoiceOver (built-in, ⌘ + F5 to start).
   * **Chrome:** ChromeVox extension (simple to use).
2. With the screen reader on, navigate your chosen site:

   * Use the **Tab key** to move through interactive elements (links, buttons, menus).
   * Use arrow keys to read headings or paragraphs.
3. Observe:

   * Are links and buttons announced clearly, or do they sound vague (e.g., “click here”)?
   * Does the reading order make sense, or is it confusing?
   * Are images announced with useful alternative text, or skipped entirely?
4. Note at least **3 strengths** and **3 weaknesses**.

## Step 3 — Color Contrast Check

1. Open a color contrast tool:

   * **WebAIM Contrast Checker** ([https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/))
   * Or use the **Accessibility Insights** browser extension.
2. Sample text and background colors from your chosen site.

   * Pro tip: Use **DevTools** → Inspector to copy the hex codes.
3. Test if the color combinations meet WCAG AA standards:

   * Normal text requires **4.5:1** contrast ratio.
   * Large text (18px+) requires **3:1**.
4. Record at least **2 examples** where contrast passes, and **2 where it fails**.

## Step 4 — Keyboard Navigation

1. Close your mouse or trackpad — don’t use it.
2. Navigate the site using only your keyboard:

   * **Tab** → move forward.
   * **Shift + Tab** → move backward.
   * **Enter** → activate a link or button.
   * **Spacebar / Arrow keys** → scroll or interact with menus.
3. Evaluate:

   * Can you reach all menus, forms, and links?
   * Is there a visible **focus indicator** (e.g., a highlight around the active link)?
   * Do dropdowns or popups open when focused, or only with a mouse?
4. Note accessibility issues that a keyboard-only user would face.

## Step 5 — Build Your Accessibility Checklist

Use your findings to create a **1-page checklist** for the chosen site.
Your checklist should include:

* **Screen Reader:** headings, links, images, reading order.
* **Color Contrast:** pass/fail examples with notes.
* **Keyboard Navigation:** what worked, what didn’t.
* **General Observations:** what the site did well, and what needs improvement.

Format: bulleted list, tables, or short notes.

**Submission:** Upload as a PDF or Word doc.

## Reflection — Key Takeaways

Write a short (½ page) reflection on:

* What surprised you most when testing the site with accessibility tools?
* Did you find issues you never noticed before?
* How does this activity change the way you think about designing for users?
* Which accessibility principle do you think is most important to carry into your future projects?
